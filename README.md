# TimeUnitConverter
Basic time unit converter using c# console app (.NET framework)

Kind of poorly written, as negatives, decimals and thousand separators are not supported, but I will eventually add them one day.

## Time units available:
    millisecond
    second
    minute
    hour
    day
    week
    month (30.436875 days)
    year (365.2425 days)
    decade
    century
    millennium

## How this works:
1: takes initial input from user in one of the chosen units of time

2: math

3: outputs the total time split between the various units of measurement

4: profit??

## Program in function:
    [ms, sec, min, hr, d, w, mo, yr, dec, c, mi]
    Enter desired unit of measurement from the list above:
    sec
    Enter desired amount of time (sec):
    1628884
    0 mi
    0 c
    0 dec
    0 yr
    0 mo
    2 w
    4 d
    20 hr
    28 min
    4 sec
    0 ms
